## Issue contribution

Open an issue if:
- You encounter problems installing or using neomap
- You find something that looks like a bug (even if you are unsure)
- You would like us to include a new feature


## Documentation contribution

Right now the documentation is hosted on GitHub wiki: https://github.com/stellasia/neomap/wiki. Contact me if you would like to help improving it.


## Code contribution

1. Let the others know you are working on the topic:
    - comment on an existing issue or
    - create a new issue if the topic is new. It will also allow us to make sure we are all aligned with the direction we want to push the project to.
2. Clone the repo and start a new branch on your local clone
3. Develop on your branch
4. Make sure you are not breaking tests and potentially add new ones (ok, given the state of the tests right now, this is not a big constraint)
5. Open a PR againt the dev branch referencing the issue
